\section{Introduction}
  \subsection{Motivation and Goals}

In this article, I will share my journey of learning Camunda, an open-source platform for workflow and decision automation. As businesses strive for efficiency and agility, understanding tools like Camunda becomes crucial for streamlining processes and optimizing operations. I am very motivated to explore this powerful platform, and I embarked on a learning adventure to uncover the possibilities it offers.

Throughout this article, I will provide insights into the fundamentals of BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) and its role in visualizing and modeling business processes. I will then dive into my experience with Camunda after using it in a small project, I'll also give a brief step by step learning journey from the initial installation and setup to exploring the Camunda Modeler, which allowed me to create clear and concise process diagrams.

I will also share valuable lessons learned,
